"""Enforce the file-size rule: no Python file grows past its size and line limit.

The rule (``CODE_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md`` → File Size Limits) keeps every module
small enough to read and review in one go. Nothing else enforces it: ruff has
no file-level limit and ``check-added-large-files`` only looks at files of
hundreds of kilobytes.

Walks every directory in ``SCOPES``, measures each ``*.py`` file, and exits
non-zero if a file exceeds its size or its line limit. A file exactly at a
limit passes.

Usage:
